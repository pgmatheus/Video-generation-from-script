      "Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the heart of the countryside, there lived a young boy named Jack. Jack was a curious and adventurous boy, always eager to explore and discover new things. One day, while wandering through the fields and forests surrounding his home, he stumbled upon a strange and curious situation.\n",
      "As he was walking, he heard a faint buzzing noise in the distance. As he followed the sound, he came upon a clearing in the forest where he saw a group of bees gathered around a small pond. But as he approached, he realized that these were not ordinary bees. They were larger and had a bright, iridescent sheen to their bodies.\n",
      "Jack was fascinated by these strange bees and decided to investigate further. As he approached the pond, he noticed that the bees were not collecting nectar from flowers, but instead, they were diving into the water and emerging with small, sparkling jewels in their claws.\n",
      "Intrigued, Jack decided to take a closer look. He slowly made his way to the edge of the pond and peered in. To his amazement, he saw that the bottom of the pond was covered in a thick layer of glittering jewels. He couldn't believe his eyes. He had discovered a hidden treasure trove of precious gems and jewels.\n",
      "Without hesitation, Jack plunged into the water and began to collect as many jewels as he could. The bees, however, were not happy with this intrusion and began to buzz around him, trying to protect their treasure. But Jack was determined and managed to collect a small handful of jewels before the bees chased him out of the clearing.\n",
      "Breathless and soaked, Jack returned home with his precious jewels. He showed them to his family and friends, and soon the news of his discovery spread throughout the town.\n",
      "Word of Jack's discovery reached the ears of a wealthy jeweler who was passing through the town. The jeweler was so impressed by the quality of the jewels that he offered to buy them all from Jack. And so, with the money he earned, Jack was able to start his own business and became a successful jeweler himself.\n",
      "From that day on, Jack never forgot the strange and curious situation he had stumbled upon in the forest. And he always remembered the bees that had guarded their treasure so fiercely, for they had helped him to make his dreams come true.\n",

    "        Once upon a time there was a generous boy called Chad Greenway. He was on the way to see his Phillip Barlow, when he decided to take a short cut through Gruesomeside Forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "It wasn't long before Chad got lost. He looked around, but all he could see were trees. Nervously, he felt into his bag for his favourite toy, Daisy, but Daisy was nowhere to be found! Chad began to panic. He felt sure he had packed Daisy. To make matters worse, he was starting to feel hungry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unexpectedly, he saw a hooting toad dressed in a blue top hat disappearing into the trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"How odd!\" thought Chad.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the want of anything better to do, he decided to follow the peculiarly dressed toad. Perhaps it could tell him the way out of the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, Chad reached a clearing. He found himself surrounded by houses made from different sorts of food. There was a house made from onions, a house made from lollipops, a house made from humbugs, a house made from chips and a house made from pizzas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad could feel his tummy rumbling. Looking at the houses did nothing to ease his hunger.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hello!\" he called. \"Is anybody there?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobody replied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad looked at the roof on the closest house and wondered if it would be rude to eat somebody else's chimney. Obviously it would be impolite to eat a whole house, but perhaps it would be considered acceptable to nibble the odd fixture or lick the odd fitting, in a time of need.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cackle broke through the air, giving Chad a fright. A witch jumped into the space in front of the houses. She was carrying a cage. In that cage was Daisy!\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Daisy!\" shouted Chad. He turned to the witch. \"That's my toy!\"\n",

    "\n",

    "\"Hello Big Toad,\" said the witch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Good morning.\" The toad noticed Daisy. \"Who is this?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "\"That's nothing,\" said the next toad. \"I could eat two houses.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"There's no need to show off,\" said the witch. Just eat one front door and I'll let you have Daisy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad watched, feeling very worried. He didn't want the witch to give Daisy to Big Toad. He didn't think Daisy would like living with a hooting toad, away from his house and all his other toys.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other three toads watched while Big Toad put on his bib and withdrew a knife and fork from his pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I'll eat this whole house,\" said Big Toad. \"Just you watch!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Big Toad pulled off a corner of the front door of the house made from lollipops. He gulped it down smiling, and went back for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "   And more.\n",
    "\n",
    "      And more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, Big Toad started to get bigger - just a little bit bigger at first. But after a few more fork-fulls of lollipops, he grew to the size of a large snowball - and he was every bit as round.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Erm... I don't feel too good,\" said Big Toad.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suddenly, he started to roll. He'd grown so round that he could no longer balance!\n",

    "A woodcutter walked into the clearing. \"What's this bush doing here?\" he asked.\n",

    "\"I'm not a bush, I'm a toad!\" said Average Toad.\n",

    "\"It talks!\" exclaimed the woodcutter. \"Those talking bushes are the worst kind. I'd better take it away before somebody gets hurt.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"No! Wait!\" cried Average Toad, as the woodcutter picked her up. But the woodcutter ignored her cries and carried the toad away under his arm.\n",

    "\n",
    "      And more.\n",
    "\n",
    "After five or six platefuls, Little Toad started to fidget uncomfortably on the spot.\n",
    "\n",
    "He stopped eating chips for a moment, then grabbed another forkful.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before he could eat it, there came an almighty roar. A bottom burp louder than a rocket taking off, propelled Little Toad into the sky.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Aggghhhhhh!\" cried Little Toad. \"I'm scared of heigh...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Little Toad was never seen again.\n",

    "\n",
    "      And more.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, on the next mouthful, the food fell straight out of Tiny Toad's mouth. She tried to stuff in another forkful of pizzas, but once again, the food fell out. There just wasn't enough room left in her belly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This is just not fair!\" declared Tiny Toad, and stomped off into the forest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tiny Toad never finished eating the front door made from pizzas and Daisy remained trapped in the witch's cage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"That's it,\" said the witch. \"I win. I get to keep Daisy.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Not so fast,\" said Chad. \"There is still one front door to go. The front door of the house made from onions. And I haven't had a turn yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't have to give you a turn!\" laughed the witch. \"My game. My rules.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The woodcutter's voice carried through the forest. \"I think you should give him a chance. It's only fair.\"\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\"I'll be right back,\" said Chad.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What?\" said the witch. \"Where's your sense of impatience? I thought you wanted Daisy back.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad ignored the witch and gathered a hefty pile of sticks. He came back to the clearing and started a small camp fire. Carefully, he broke off a piece of the door of the house made from onions and toasted it over the fire. Once it had cooked and cooled just a little, he took a bite. He quickly devoured the whole piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad sat down on a nearby log.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"You fail!\" cackled the witch. \"You were supposed to eat the whole door.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I haven't finished,\" explained Chad. \"I am just waiting for my food to go down.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "When Chad's food had digested, he broke off another piece of the door made from onions. Once more, he toasted his food over the fire and waited for it to cool just a little. He ate it at a leisurely pace then waited for it to digest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, after several sittings, Chad was down to the final piece of the door made from onions. Carefully, he toasted it and allowed it to cool just a little. He finished his final course. Chad had eaten the entire front door of the house made from onions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The witch stamped her foot angrily. \"You must have tricked me!\" she said. \"I don't reward cheating!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"I don't think so!\" said a voice. It was the woodcutter. He walked back into the clearing, carrying his axe. \"This little boy won fair and square. Now hand over Daisy or I will chop your broomstick in half.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The witch looked horrified. She grabbed her broomstick and placed it behind her. Then, huffing, she opened the door of the cage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad hurried over and grabbed Daisy, checking that his favourite toy was all right. Fortunately, Daisy was unharmed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chad thanked the woodcutter, grabbed a quick souvenir, and hurried on to meet Phillip. It was starting to get dark.\n",
