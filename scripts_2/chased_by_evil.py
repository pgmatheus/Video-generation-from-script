It was a dark and stormy night, and I was walking home from a late night shift at the office. I had been feeling uneasy all day, and my uneasiness only increased as I walked along the deserted streets. The wind howled and the rain pounded against the pavement, making it difficult to see where I was going.

Suddenly, out of the corner of my eye, I saw something that made my heart stop. It was a figure, shrouded in darkness, standing in the middle of the street. I stopped in my tracks, unable to move, and the figure slowly began to approach me.

As it got closer, I could make out its features. It was a woman, her face pale and her eyes sunken. Her hair was wild and unkempt, and her clothes were tattered and torn. She was holding something in her hands, a small object that glinted in the moonlight.

I tried to run, but my feet were rooted to the ground. The woman stopped in front of me and held out the object. It was a knife, and she was holding it in a threatening manner. She spoke, her voice like a whisper, and she said, "I want you to take this knife and use it to kill yourself. If you don't, I will kill you."

I was terrified, and I didn't know what to do. I begged her to let me go, but she just kept repeating her demand. I was about to take the knife when a police car suddenly pulled up. The officers jumped out, guns drawn, and the woman quickly ran away.

The officers questioned me, and I told them what had happened. They told me that this was not the first time this woman had approached someone with a knife and made the same demand. They had been searching for her for weeks, but she had managed to elude them.
I was relieved that I had been saved, but I was also shaken by what had happened. I had come face to face with pure evil, and I was lucky to have escaped with my life. 
As I walked away from the scene, my heart was racing with fear and my mind was filled with questions. Who was that woman? What could have driven her to do such a thing? Was she mentally unstable or was she just plain evil?
I couldn't shake off the feeling of dread that had settled in my bones. Even though the police had assured me that they would catch the woman soon, I still felt like I was being watched. I quickened my pace and tried to stay in well-lit areas.
Days passed, and the incident slowly faded from my memory. I went about my usual routine, trying my best to forget about the encounter. But then, one day, I received a package in the mail. It was a small box wrapped in brown paper, with no return address.
Curiosity got the better of me, and I opened the package. Inside, I found a note and a knife. The note read, "You got lucky last time. But I'll be watching you. And when you least expect it, I'll be back."
I felt my blood run cold as I realized that the woman had found me again. She had managed to track me down and was still intent on carrying out her twisted plan. I knew that I had to act fast, but I had no idea how to protect myself.
I decided to reach out to the police and let them know about the package. They came to my apartment and took the knife as evidence, promising to keep a close eye on me. But I still couldn't shake off the feeling that the woman was always lurking in the shadows, waiting for the right moment to strike.
Months passed, and I had almost convinced myself that the woman had lost interest in me. But one night, as I was walking home from a friend's house, I saw her again. She was standing on the other side of the road, watching me with those sunken eyes.
This time, I didn't freeze. I ran as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached my apartment. I locked the door and sat down, my heart pounding in my chest.
Years have passed since that fateful night, and I have never seen the woman again. But the memory of her still haunts me to this day. I have learned to live with the fear, to use it as a reminder to always stay vigilant. But I will never forget the horror that I experienced, the terror that nearly consumed me.
