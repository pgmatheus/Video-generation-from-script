"25": "Long-Term vs Short-Term Investment.",
"26": "Stocks can be bought for both long-term investments and short-term investments.",
"27": "If you are looking for long-term growth, you might want to invest in a stock with the goal of capital appreciation, which is the increase in the stock's value over time.",

"29": "Stock Indices.",
"30": "A stock index is a grouping of stocks used to measure the performance of a particular market or sector.",

"36": "If you are new to investing in stocks, you might consider working with a stockbroker to help you navigate the stock market and make informed investment decisions.",
"37": "Risk and Return.",
"38": "Investing in stocks involves risk, but historically, stocks have offered higher returns compared to other investments such as bonds.",
"39": "The key is to understand the risks involved and make informed decisions about when to buy and sell.",
"40": "Dividends.",
"41": "Finally, some stocks pay dividends, which are payments made by the company to its shareholders, usually on a quarterly basis.",
